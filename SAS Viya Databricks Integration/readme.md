### Exercise 1: Basic Connectivity Setup
**Goal:** Configure SAS Viya to connect to Databricks using sample connectivity codes.

**Tasks:**
1. Review and execute the SAS code to establish a connection to Databricks.
2. Validate the connection by checking the log for any errors.

### Exercise 2: Data Operations and SQL Passthrough
**Goal:** Execute SQL operations and data manipulations using the provided sample codes.

**Tasks:**
1. Perform data transfer between SAS Viya and Databricks using the sample code.
2. Explore implicit and explicit SQL passthrough techniques.

### Exercise 3: Bulkload Operations
**Goal:** Implement the bulkload feature to efficiently manage large data transfers.

**Tasks:**
1. Configure and execute the bulkload operations using the given sample code.
2. Observe and discuss the logs to understand the performance improvements.

### Exercise 4: Loading Data Directly to CAS
**Goal:** Load data directly into CAS from Databricks and perform data operations.

**Tasks:**
1. Use the sample code to load specific datasets into CAS.
2. Manipulate and analyze the data using SAS Viyaâ€™s capabilities.

### Exercise 6: Explore SAS Information Catalog
**Goal:** Participants explore Databricks tables (profiled) through SAS Information catalog

## Wrap-Up and Review
**Goal:** Ensure participants can apply what they've learned in real-world scenarios.

**Tasks:**
1. Participants summarize what they've learned.
2. Open Q&A session to resolve any queries and ensure clarity on all exercises.

## Conclusion
Recap the session and discuss how these techniques can be applied in various data integration scenarios between SAS Viya and Databricks.
